# Portfolio Design 

**Original Design gathered from:**
```git
git clone https://github.com/ProgrammingHero1/portfolio-resources.git
```

**Goal:**
- [x] Finish the portfolio design from figma.
- [ ] Make it responsive for **smaller**, **medium** and **large** display.

**Issue:**
1. Could not utilize the `js.PNG` image. Instead of that I've used another image. 
2. On the footer section. "Message" text could not fit in top-left just like org figma file.
3. Forgot to use `button` on the button section. But instead of button I've used `<div>`.
